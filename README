Example
-------

I wanted to install `frogatto <https://packages.debian.org/unstable/frogatto>`_:

.. code:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install frogatto
   Reading package lists... Done
   Building dependency tree... Done
   Reading state information... Done
   The following additional packages will be installed:
      frogatto-data (1.3.1+dfsg-3)
   The following NEW packages will be installed:
      frogatto (1.3.1+dfsg-5+b2)
      frogatto-data (1.3.1+dfsg-3)
   0 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 9 not upgraded.

   Abort.

OK, that's too much to handle for my Internet connection.

Instead, I can ask *mooflon* for the list of download URLs
and put it on a USB stick:

.. code:: console

   $ mooflon -p apt-get install frogatto | tee /media/sdx/deb-index
   https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/f/frogatto-data/frogatto-data_1.3.1%2bdfsg-3_all.deb
   https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/contrib/f/frogatto/frogatto_1.3.1%2bdfsg-5%2bb2_i386.deb

Let's download the packages on a machine with a faster Internet connection:

.. code:: console

   $ cd /media/sdx

   $ wget -nv -i deb-index
   2022-01-19 23:37:42 URL:https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/f/frogatto-data/frogatto-data_1.3.1%2bdfsg-3_all.deb [224725856/224725856] -> "frogatto-data_1.3.1+dfsg-3_all.deb" [1]
   2022-01-19 23:37:42 URL:https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/contrib/f/frogatto/frogatto_1.3.1%2bdfsg-5%2bb2_i386.deb [2091020/2091020] -> "frogatto_1.3.1+dfsg-5+b2_i386.deb" [1]

   Total wall clock time: 14s
   Downloaded: 2 files, 216M in 14s (15.9 MB/s)

Now I can use *mooflon* to perform the install
using the packages from the USB stick:

.. code:: console

   $ sudo mooflon -i /media/sdx/*.deb -- apt-get install frogatto
   mooflon: /media/sdx/frogatto-data_1.3.1+dfsg-3_all.deb -> /var/cache/apt/archives/frogatto-data_1.3.1+dfsg-3_all.deb
   mooflon: /media/sdx/frogatto_1.3.1+dfsg-5+b2_i386.deb -> /var/cache/apt/archives/frogatto_1.3.1+dfsg-5+b2_i386.deb
